# text-to-sql-llm
This project is a text-to-SQL web application that allows users to query Ethereum transaction data using natural language. It fetches real-time data from the Etherscan API, stores it in a MySQL database, and uses LangChain and the ChatGroq model to translate user questions into SQL queries for instant results via a Streamlit interface.
